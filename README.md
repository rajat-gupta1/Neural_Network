# Project 4 Milestone 1

## Training Details:
Samples: 1000  
Hidden Layers: 1  
Nodes in Hidden Layer: 20  
Training Samples = 1000  

## Calculations 

Grind Rate: 4000 (iterations) * 1000 (samples) / 804.4 (time) * 10 (batch size) = 49,726  
Cost: 0.001  
Train Accuracy: 93.9%  
Test Accuracy: 76.7%
